## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# DATA PREPARATION

## IMPORT DATASET
```{r}
giantanteater <- read_csv("C:/Users/achhen.stu/OneDrive - UBC/BIOL 452 Directed Studies - Giant Anteaters/Anteater Dataset/giantanteater.csv")
```

## TELEMETRY FORMAT
Convert dataset to a telemetry object, assuming the data has been cleaned and containing no outliers
```{r}
DATA <- as.telemetry("C:/Users/achhen.stu/OneDrive - UBC/BIOL 452 Directed Studies - Giant Anteaters/Anteater Dataset/giantanteater.csv") # n=19

```
