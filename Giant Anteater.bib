	abstract = {Giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) populations are decreasing throughout their range. We tested a methodology for individual identiﬁcation using camera records and fur patterns to estimate the giant anteater population in a protected area of the Brazilian Cerrado. We identiﬁed 9 adult individuals and successfully modeled population abundance and density. Our models estimated an adult population of 16.8 (range = 15–19) giant anteaters through a mark‐resight approach and 12.5 individuals (range = 9.7–25.5) through a spatially explicit capture‐recapture approach. Density estimates were 0.3–0.4 animals/km2. Using these estimates, we performed a population viability analysis to understand and predict this population's future. We modeled scenarios without direct eﬀects and models simulating a double carrying capacity and the supplementation and removal of individuals. Even in the more optimistic scenarios, the population is predicted to decreases over time, with ≤8 individuals remaining in 100 years. Given the study area surroundings, realistic models include removals of giant anteaters in the population. Identiﬁcation of giant anteaters using cameras can inspire conservationists to acquire population data throughout its distribution and obtain population trends to evaluate the species' conservation status. Individual identiﬁcation of giant anteaters using a motion‐sensitive camera design is feasible, opens new avenues for population analyses, and allows the study of population trends in diﬃcult regions. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {This research presents novel data on tree marking by the giant anteater, a large Neotropical mammal threatened in the state of Paraná and other areas of Brazil, and nearly threatened worldwide. Field work was carried out in the municipality of Jaguariaíva, Paraná (Southern Brazil) with the goal of evaluating the pine marking behavior of the giant anteater and ascertaining whether wildfires interfere with it. Anteater marks were searched for on the trunks of pine trees in stands as well as pine trees dispersed throughout the landscape. For each pine tree, the following features were recorded: height, diameter breast height (DBH), height of first branch, presence/absence of scratch marks, geographical location, substrate, and matrix. The total number of scratches, scratch directions, scratch length, and height of top mark were also recorded. The scratches were defined as horizontal or vertical. Tree scratching was directly observed in three instances. Ninety-one trees were measured in the study area. The differences between marked and non-marked pines were significant for DBH and height of first branch. All scratches were found on pines dispersed throughout the landscape. Trees with horizontal and vertical marks were significantly different in terms of DBH, first branch height, and top mark height. After a wildfire that affected part of the study area, 54\% of the previously marked trees were marked anew. We suggest that the marking behavior is used for communication between conspecifics with overlapping home ranges, possibly during the mating season. Additionally, we advance the hypothesis that pine marking behavior becomes more frequent with increased population stress due to anthropic interference.},

	abstract = {The impact of environmental change on the reproduction and survival of wildlife is often behaviourally mediated, placing behavioural ecology in a central position to quantify population- and community-level consequences of anthropogenic threats to biodiversity. This theme issue demonstrates how recent conceptual and methodological advances in the discipline are applied to inform conservation. The issue highlights how the focus in behavioural ecology on understanding variation in behaviour between individuals, rather than just measuring the population mean, is critical to explaining demographic stochasticity and thereby reducing fuzziness of population models. The contributions also show the importance of knowing the mechanisms by which behaviour is achieved, i.e. the role of learning, reasoning and instincts, in order to understand how behaviours change in human-modified environments, where their function is less likely to be adaptive. More recent work has thus abandoned the ‘adaptationist’ paradigm of early behavioural ecology and increasingly measures evolutionary processes directly by quantifying selection gradients and phenotypic plasticity. To support quantitative predictions at the population and community levels, a rich arsenal of modelling techniques has developed, and interdisciplinary approaches show promising prospects for predicting the effectiveness of alternative management options, with the social sciences, movement ecology and epidemiology particularly pertinent. The theme issue furthermore explores the relevance of behaviour for global threat assessment, and practical advice is given as to how behavioural ecologists can augment their conservation impact by carefully selecting and promoting their study systems, and increasing their engagement with local communities, natural resource managers and policy-makers. Its aim to uncover the nuts and bolts of how natural systems work positions behavioural ecology squarely in the heart of conservation biology, where its perspective offers an all-important complement to more descriptive ‘big-picture’ approaches to priority setting.

Female mating bonds include long-term monogamy, serial monogamy, polyandry and promiscuity. Both male and female mating behaviour varies widely within species. Variation in male mating behaviour is related to the effect of male assistance in rearing young and to the defensibility of females by males. The latter is, in turn, related to female ranging behaviour and to the size and stability of female groups. Much of the variation in mammalian mating bonds and systems of mate guarding can be attributed to differences in these three variables.},

In contrast, some recent re-interpretations have argued that many aspects of social organization should be interpreted as group-level adaptations maintained by selection operating between groups or populations. Here, I review our current understanding of the evolution of mammalian societies, focusing, in particular, on the evolution of reproductive strategies in societies where one dominant female monopolizes reproduction in each group and her offspring are reared by other group members. Recent studies of the life histories of females in these species show that dispersing females often have little chance of establishing new breeding groups and so are likely to maximize their inclusive fitness by helping related dominants to rear their offspring. As in eusocial insects, increasing group size can lead to a progressive divergence in the selection pressures operating on breeders and helpers and to increasing specialization in their behaviour and life histories. As yet, there is little need to invoke group-level adaptations in order to account for the behaviour of individuals or the structure of mammalian groups.},

              Cost-benefit trade-offs for individuals participating in social behaviors are the basis for current theories on the evolution of social behaviors and societies. However, research on social strategies has largely ignored solitary animals, in which we assume that rare interactions are explained by courtship or territoriality or, in special circumstances, resource distributions or kinship. We used directed network analysis of conspecific tolerance at food sources to provide evidence that a solitary carnivore, the puma (
              Puma concolor
              ), exhibited adaptive social strategies similar to more social animals. Every puma in our analysis participated in the network, which featured densely connected communities delineated by territorial males. Territorial males also structured social interactions among pumas. Contrary to expectations, conspecific tolerance was best characterized by direct reciprocity, establishing a fitness benefit to individuals that participated in social behaviors. However, reciprocity operated on a longer time scale than in gregarious species. Tolerance was also explained by hierarchical reciprocity, which we defined as network triangles in which one puma (generally male) received tolerance from two others (generally females) that also tolerated each other. Hierarchical reciprocity suggested that males might be cheating females; nevertheless, we suspect that males and females used different fitness currencies. For example, females may have benefited from tolerating males through the maintenance of social niches that support breeding opportunities. Our work contributes evidence of adaptive social strategies in a solitary carnivore and support for the applicability of theories of social behavior across taxa, including solitary species in which they are rarely tested.},

	abstract = {Background
              Ecological adaptations of mammals are reflected in the morphological diversity of their feeding apparatus, which includes differences in tooth crown morphologies, variation in snout size, or changes in muscles of the feeding apparatus. The adaptability of their feeding apparatus allowed them to optimize resource exploitation in a wide range of habitats. The combination of computer-assisted X-ray microtomography (µ-CT) with contrast-enhancing staining protocols has bolstered the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) models of muscles. This new approach allows for accurate descriptions of muscular anatomy, as well as the quick measurement of muscle volumes and fiber orientation. Ant- and termite-eating (myrmecophagy) represents a case of extreme feeding specialization, which is usually accompanied by tooth reduction or complete tooth loss, snout elongation, acquisition of a long vermiform tongue, and loss of the zygomatic arch. Many of these traits evolved independently in distantly-related mammalian lineages. Previous reports on South American anteaters (Vermilingua) have shown major changes in the masticatory, intermandibular, and lingual muscular apparatus. These changes have been related to a functional shift in the role of upper and lower jaws in the evolutionary context of their complete loss of teeth and masticatory ability.

                Myrmecophaga tridactyla
                ) anteaters. We reconstructed the musculature of the feeding apparatus of the three extant anteater genera using 3D reconstructions complemented with classical dissections of the specimens. We performed a description of the musculature of the feeding apparatus in the two morphologically divergent vermilinguan families (Myrmecophagidae and Cyclopedidae) and compared it to the association of morphological features found in other myrmecophagous placentals.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We found that pygmy anteaters (
                Cyclopes
                ) present a relatively larger and architecturally complex temporal musculature than that of collared (
                Tamandua
                ) and giant (
                Myrmecophaga
                ) anteaters, but shows a reduced masseter musculature, including the loss of the deep masseter. The loss of this muscle concurs with the loss of the jugal bone in Cyclopedidae. We show that anteaters, pangolins, and aardvarks present distinct anatomies despite morphological and ecological convergences.},

	abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Knowing the influence of intrinsic and environmental traits on animals’ movement is a central interest of ecology and can aid to enhance management decisions. The giant anteater (
              Myrmecophaga tridactyla
              ) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters’ movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies.},

	abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as “noise” when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called ‘behavioral syndromes’. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual’s risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

	abstract = {In movement ecology, the few works that have taken collective behaviour into account are data-driven and rely on simplistic theoretical assumptions, relying in metrics that may or may not be measuring what is intended. In the present paper, we focus on pairwise joint-movement behaviour, where individuals move together during at least a segment of their path. We investigate the adequacy of twelve metrics introduced in previous works for assessing joint movement by analysing their theoretical properties and confronting them with contrasting case scenarios. Two criteria are taken into account for review of those metrics: 1) practical use, and 2) dependence on parameters and underlying assumptions. When analysing the similarities between the metrics as defined, we show how some of them can be expressed using general mathematical forms. In addition, we evaluate the ability of each metric to assess specific aspects of joint-movement behaviour: proximity (closeness in space-time) and coordination (synchrony) in direction and speed. We found that some metrics are better suited to assess proximity and others are more sensitive to coordination. To help readers choose metrics, we elaborate a graphical representation of the metrics in the coordination and proximity space based on our results, and give a few examples of proximity and coordination focus in different movement studies.},

	abstract = {The emergence of technologies capable of storing detailed records of object locations has presented scientists and researchers with a wealth of data on object movement. Yet analytical methods for investigating more advanced research questions from such detailed movement datasets remain limited in scope and sophistication. Recent advances in the study of movement data has focused on characterizing types of dynamic interactions, such as single-file motion, while little progress has been made on quantifying the degree of such interactions. In this article, we introduce a new method for measuring dynamic interactions (termed DI) between pairs of moving objects. Simulated movement datasets are used to compare DI with an existing correlation statistic. Two applied examples, team sports and wildlife, are used to further demonstrate the value of the DI approach. The DI method is advantageous in that it measures interaction in both movement direction (termed azimuth) and displacement. Also, the DI approach can be applied at local, interval, episodal, and global levels of analysis. However the DI method is limited to situations where movements of two objects are recorded at simultaneous points in time. In conclusion, DI quantifies the level of dynamic interaction between two moving objects, allowing for more thorough investigation of processes affecting interactive moving objects.},

	abstract = {Understanding animal movement is essential to elucidate how animals interact, survive, and thrive in a changing world. Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal “movement ecology” (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences.

            Animal tracking in a big data world
            
              So-called “big-data” approaches have revolutionized fields of research from astronomy to genetics. Such approaches are not limited to fields that seem inherently technical, because the combination of rapid data collection and advanced analytical techniques could be applied to almost any scientific question.

Large-scale data collection can reveal details about how animals use their environment and interact with each other that were impossible to explore previously. Such methodological shifts will open new avenues of research—and conservation—across species. —SNV

            A review suggests that modern “big-data” techniques are vastly increasing our understanding of animal movement and its ecology.

              BACKGROUND
              Movement is ubiquitous across the natural world. All organisms move, actively or passively, regularly or during specific life stages, as a result of varied proximate drivers including energetic demands, social interactions, competition or predation. Movement closely interacts with individual fitness, affects a myriad of ecological processes, and is crucial for animals’ ability to cope with human-induced rapid environmental changes. Driven by advances in analytical methods and technologies for tracking mammals, birds, fish, and other free-ranging vertebrates (hereafter, wildlife), movement ecology is rapidly transforming into a data-rich discipline, following previous developments in fields such as genomics and environmental monitoring. This ongoing revolution is facilitated by cost-effective automated high-throughput wildlife tracking systems that generate massive high-resolution datasets across scales relevant to the ecological context in which animals perceive, interact with, and respond to their environment.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Modern tracking technologies efficiently generate copious, accurate information on the movements of multiple individual animals in the wild. Reverse-GPS technologies, which primarily use acoustic signals under water and radio signals over land, are automated high-throughput systems that are highly cost- and power-effective and capable of simultaneous tracking of multiple small animals (e.g., 20-g birds) at high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., 1-s interval, a few meters) for months, but they require system installation and are usually limited to regional scales (≤100 km wide). GPS-based systems are, by contrast, readily available, longer term, and cover nearly global scales, but are similarly spatially accurate and periodically capable of high-resolution tracking at regional scales. However, they are more cost- and power-demanding, limited to larger animals, and cannot be applied under water. Two other tracking technologies, radar and computer vision, permit high-resolution snapshots of the movement of multiple individuals and can noninvasively track nontagged animals, but are less cost-effective, usually limited to smaller scales, and make individual identification challenging. Combined, these high-throughput technologies enable groundbreaking research in animal behavior, cognitive sciences, evolution, and ecology, facilitating previously infeasible investigation of animal movement ecology. Big movement data can help link interindividual variation in movement to individual behavior, traits, cognition and physiology; divulge fine-scale interactions within or among species; improve evidence-based management of human-wildlife interactions; and elucidate behavioral changes across spatiotemporal scales.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              High-throughput wildlife tracking technologies are opening new research frontiers in biology and ecology. Their advantages, however, come with typical big-data costs such as computational load, intensive data management and processing, and challenging statistical analyses. Enlisting fields with a longer history of big data offers new prospects to address these challenges. Progress will arise from combining observational and experimental movement ecology and data-rich studies revealing behavioral shifts across individuals, species, scales, ecosystems, and life stages. High-resolution wildlife tracking is currently infeasible at large to global scales, a key limitation that can be addressed by combining low- and high-rate sampling, increasing interoperability between technologies, standardizing and sharing data, and promoting multidisciplinary international collaboration. Coupling movement and environmental big data could help determine impacts of major environmental and climate changes on animal–environment interactions, whereas real-time movement data could uniquely inform biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.
              
                
                  Why do high-throughput movement data matter?
                  Big movement data are essential for addressing key ecological questions, as conclusions based on traditional lower-resolution data could differ markedly from the correct conclusions. We illustrate several examples for contrasting conclusions derived from lower- versus higher-resolution data of the same tracks from the same number of animals. Higher-resolution data can reveal that bolder birds visit more sites across the landscape and that bird tracks frequently cross each other, suggesting high potential for disease transmission, and that fish avoid fisheries and frequently search locally within small patches. None of these conclusions, however, could have been drawn from lower-resolution data. See also movies S1 to S5.},

	abstract = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) represent a serious source of mortality for many species, threatening local populations’ persistence while also carrying high economic and human safety costs. Animals may adapt their behaviour to roadassociated threats, but roadside resources can also attract individuals to dangerous roadside habitats, ultimately acting as an ecological trap. Yet, the extent to which individuals modify their behaviour and space use to roads is largely unknown for most taxonomic groups. Using ﬁne-scale movement data from 38 giant anteaters Myrmecophaga tridactyla tracked in the Brazilian Cerrado, we aimed to identify facets of movement behaviour that might exhibit plasticity to roads and trafﬁc volume. Speciﬁcally, the analysis of daily and instantaneous movement speeds, homerange characteristics and crossing rates/times allowed us to test for an effect of road proximity, trafﬁc volume and natural linear features on movement behaviour. We found no effect of road proximity or trafﬁc volume on space use or movement behaviour. While individuals tended to reduce their movement speed when approaching roads and crossed roads {\textasciitilde}3 times less than would have been expected by random chance, none of the three highways we monitored were impervious. The majority of tracked anteaters living near roads ({\textless}2 km) crossed them, with higher crossing rates for males than females. Habitat near roads may function as an ecological trap where healthy individuals occupy the territories nearby or bisected by roads but eventually are road-killed given their regular crossings, leaving the territory vacant for subsequent occupation. Crucially, we found no evidence that anteaters actively searched for passage structures to cross the roads. This suggests that crossing structures alone are unlikely to mitigate WVC-induced mortality in giant anteaters. Our research reinforces the need to implement fencing, leading to existing passages, and minimizing the amount of night-time driving to reduce the number of WVCs.},

              In solitary carnivorous mammals, territoriality is assumed to benefit male fitness by ensuring the exclusivity of matings within territories via mate guarding and female defence. However, this hypothesis remains empirically untested. Here, we examined this hypothesis for solitary territorial carnivores using the Iberian lynx
              (Lynx pardinus)
              as a case study. We expected that territorial males sire all litters born within their territories, translating into the absence of multi-paternity cases within the same litter. We analysed parentage in 43 kittens, belonging to 20 different litters. For 42 kittens, a father could be assigned using microsatellites and always coincided with the individual holding the territory. For 16 kittens from 10 litters for which we also had information on SNPs, paternity assignments coincided with microsatellites, except for a litter (two kittens) from the same litter for which a different male was assigned, but the territorial male could not be excluded. Our results indicated that multi-paternity in the Iberian lynx must be a rare event, and that territorial males sire all litters born from the females with which they share territories. We propose that both the low number of mature individuals in the lynx population and the fact that female oestrus is induced by male presence may explain results.},

While some aspects of social systems have been extensively studied, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize social organization across species. Here, we present a framework describing eight dimensions of social organization to capture its diversity across mammalian societies. The framework uses simple information that is clearly separated from the three other aspects of social systems: social structure, care system, and mating system. By applying our framework across 208 species of all mammalian taxa, we find a rich multidimensional landscape of social organization. Correlation analysis reveals that the dimensions have relatively high independence, suggesting that social systems are able to evolve different aspects of social behavior without being tied to particular traits. Applying a clustering algorithm allows us to identify the relative importance of key dimensions on patterns of social organization. Finally, mapping mating system onto these clusters shows that social organization represents a distinct aspect of social systems. In the future, this framework will aid reporting on important aspects of natural history in species and facilitate comparative analyses, which ultimately will provide the ability to generate new insights into the primary drivers of social patterns and evolution of sociality., Social organization is an aspect of animal social systems that has not been conceptualized yet and is often reduced to group size. This framework describes eight central dimensions of social organization to capture its diversity across mammalian societies.

	abstract = {Black bears (Ursus americanus) were studied in northeastern Minnesota from 1969 through 1985 to determine (1) the annual cycle of foraging and social behavior, (2) changes in mother-offspring relationships from birth through maturity, (3) the influence of food availability on social behavior, movements, and population growth, and (4) important habitat components. Studies were most intensive during 1971-76 when 28 males and 55 females were radio-tracked. The study area had relatively few fruit and mast species and a frost-free growing season of only 118 days. Crop failures were common and reduced the reproductive rate to less than half the biological potential. Females first reproduced at 4-8 years of age (average 6.3 years), depending upon food supply, and produced subsequent litters at 2-4-year intervals (average 2.28 years). Litters averaged 2.38 cubs. Cub survival was 59-88\%, depending on food supply in the year of conception and the year of birth. Bears that supplemented their diets with garbage reproduced nearly twice as fast as the above. Density was {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{bear\}/4.1-6.3{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, including cubs. The annual cycle of behavior was closely tied to the annual cycle of plant growth and fruiting. Bears emerged from dens in late March or April, depending in part on weather, but females and subadults remained lethargic until late April or early May when aspen (Populus spp.) catkins and young green vegetation became available. Mature females then re-established territories averaging {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$9.6{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, and mature males used overlapping mating ranges averaging {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$75{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. Mating began about 10 June and was essentially completed by 9 July when fruit began to ripen in abundance. Foraging then became the main activity until fruit and nuts disappeared in late summer. Sixty-seven percent of the males and 40\% of the females foraged {\textgreater}7 km outside their territories or mating ranges in late summer or early fall, moving up to 200 km away before returning for denning. Adult males that remained in their mating ranges after the mating season spent a disproportionate amount of time in the buffer zones between female territories rather than inside them. Despite generally solitary habits, bears behaved in accordance with kinship theory within a social order governed mainly by the distribution and abundance of food. Mothers recognized their independent offspring and tolerated them in their territories. Mothers avoided areas where their yearlings concentrated their activities, thereby allowing them to have nearly exclusive feeding areas. Young males voluntarily dispersed as subadults and settled 13-219 km away (average 61 km). Young females usually expanded their yearling ranges into adult territories. Mothers shifted away as their daughters expanded their ranges, thereby aiding daughters in obtaining territories. Adults of both sexes deterred immigration. The bears behaved as described above where food was dispersed, but formed hierarchies where food was clumped as at garbage dumps. There, female territories overlapped slightly, and males commonly tolerated individual distances of {\textless}2 m. Play was common among bears up to 4.7 years old around garbage dumps but was not seen elsewhere except among cubs. Adult females used garbage dumps in their territories but avoided other dumps where unfamiliar adult males congregated. The denning period was 5-7 months. Very fat bears abandoned food and entered dens in late September. Less fat bears that found food continued to feed as late as early November. Bears in northeastern Minnesota achieved a deeper hibernation than has been reported from regions with shorter denning periods. Hibernating bears commonly did not awaken in midwinter until after several minutes of prodding. Overwinter mortality was {\textless}1\% regardless of den type, but lightweight yearlings starved after emergence in spring. Starvation was the main cause of death among cubs and yearlings, and gunshot was the main cause of death among older bears. Bears commonly roamed farther in northeastern Minnesota than has been reported from other regions. A larger area of unbroken habitat may be needed to maintain this population than would be needed where food is more reliable and abundant. Habitat management practices beneficial to bears in northeastern Minnesota are identified.},

              An individual’s spatial behavior is shaped by social and environmental factors and provides critical information about population processes to inform conservation and management actions. Heterogeneity in spatial overlap among conspecifics can be evaluated using estimates of home ranges and core areas and used to understand factors influencing space use and territoriality. To understand and test predictions about spatial behavior in an invasive large mammal, the wild pig (
              Sus scrofa
              ), we examined variation in space use between sexes and seasons. We predicted that if animals were territorial that there would be a reduction in space-use overlap when comparing overlap of home ranges (HR–HR), to home ranges and core areas (HR–CA), and in-turn between core areas (CA–CA). Home ranges and core areas were estimated for 54 wild pigs at Buck Island Ranch, FL from GPS telemetry data. Overlap indices were calculated to estimate the strength (space-use overlap) and number of potential interactions within three wet seasons (June–October) and two dry seasons (December–April). Among sexes, home range size did not vary seasonally, and males exhibited larger home ranges compared to females (M = 10.36 ± 0.79 km
              2
              (± SE), F = 3.21 ± 0.16 km
              2
              ). Strength of overlap varied by season with wild pig home ranges overlapping more during the dry season. Males interacted with a greater number of individuals of both sexes, compared to females, and exhibited greater strength of overlap during the dry season. Consistent with our predictions, wild pigs appeared to exhibit territorial behavior, where strength of overlap decreased when comparing HR–HR to HR–CA and HR–CA to CA–CA. Our framework can be used to understand patterns of space use and territoriality in populations, which has important implications in understanding intraspecific interactions and population processes, such as how pathogens and parasites might spread within and among populations.},

	abstract = {Pilosa include anteaters (Vermilingua) and sloths (Folivora). Modern tree sloths are represented by two genera, Bradypus and Choloepus (both around 4–6 kg), whereas the fossil record is very diverse, with approximately 90 genera ranging in age from the Oligocene to the early Holocene. Fossil sloths include four main clades, Megalonychidae, Megatheriidae, Nothrotheriidae, and Mylodontidae, ranging in size from tens of kilograms to several tons. Modern Vermilingua are represented by three genera, Cyclopes, Tamandua and Myrmecophaga, with a size range from 0.25 kg to about 30 kg, and their fossil record is scarce and fragmentary. The dependence of the body size on phylogenetic pattern of Pilosa is analysed here, according to current cladistic hypotheses. Orthonormal decomposition analysis and Abouheif C-mean were performed. Statistics were signiﬁcantly different from the null-hypothesis, supporting the hypothesis that body size variation correlates with the phylogenetic pattern. Most of the correlation is concentrated within Vermilingua, and less within Mylodontidae, Megatheriidae, Nothrotheriidae and Megalonychidae. Inﬂuence of basal metabolic rate (BMR), dietary habits and substrate preference is discussed. In anteaters, specialised insectivory is proposed as the primary constraint on body size evolution. In the case of sloths, mylodontids, megatheriids and nothrotheriids show increasing body size through time; whereas megalonychids retain a wider diversity of sizes. Interplay between BMR and dietary habits appears to be the main factor in shaping evolution of sloth body size.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to correlate the activity and habitat use of a large and ecologically specialized mammal (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) with the time of day and minimum daily temperature in Brazil's Pantanal wetland. Seven giant anteaters were fitted with very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitters and monitored from March to December 2001. The animal's state of activity or rest, time and ambient temperature were recorded in different patches of the study site, which were covered by a mosaic of vegetation types and several ponds. Whenever a giant anteater was inside a forest patch, the temperature inside and outside of the patch was also recorded. The temperatures throughout the day were recorded by the meteorological station at the study site. The period of greatest activity of giant anteaters started at 18:00 h on hot days, but whenever the daily minimum temperature declined, the species' activity began earlier. Giant anteaters use predominantly forest habitats for rest and open habitats for activity. The forest patches work as a temperature buffer, because they are cooler than the matrix of open habitats during the hot hours of the day and warmer than the matrix during the cold hours. Although the giant anteater is known to be associated with open habitats, this study indicates the need of preserving forest patches for the conservation of this species.},
